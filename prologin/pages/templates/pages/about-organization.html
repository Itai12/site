	<h2 id="association">{% trans "A computer enthusiasts association" %}</h2>
	{% blocktrans %}
	<p class="text-justify">The purpose of Prologin is to enable young computer enthusiasts to meet and compete with each other. Indeed,
	computer science is still largely under represented in French schools. Therefore, those who practice it are
	often self-taught and have an individual practice of it. However, any large project requires teamwork. This is
	why, even though candidates seat the exam individually, the competition should facilitate the exchange of ideas
	between candidates. To promote these exchanges, the Prologin team tries to design the contest topics so they
	put forward playful aspects. Meanwhile, everything is done so that participants can and should exchange ideas
	within a cheerful atmoshpere. Combining work and pleasure is therefore a key objective of Prologin.</p>

	<p class="text-justify">We want to allow candidates to take advantage of the competition to enhance their skills. We try to cover as
	many areas of computer science: artificial intelligence algorithms, general culture, various programming
	languages…</p>

	<p class="text-justify">For the organizers, the competition is an opportunity to manage a team and to organize a event. We must also
	learn how to communicate effectively in order to make it known to a wider public. Managing relations with
	sponsors, creating statements and solving both technological and logistic issues are also an enriching
	experiences for our staff members.</p>

	<p class="text-justify">Finally, for all the survivors who reach the final, it is also the opportunity to spend a super crazy weekend
	with us!</p>

	<h2 id="contribute">{% trans "Everyone can contribute to Prologin" %}</h2>
	{# TODO: link to forums; link to how to promote (posters) #}
	{% blocktrans %}
	<p class="text-justify">Contributing can be done in various ways: promoting the event, developing the website and
	the software architecture for the final, helping during the semifinals, contributing in the forums, and so on.
	We also appreciate your feedback and your suggestions.</p>

	<p class="text-justify">We also need your help with the training section, where users can try themselves on a large set of statements.
	If you can give us a hand, please do: we are looking for new statments (originals or translations of third parties),
	courses, and corrections. Of course, please contact us before contributing so we can prevent certain parts
	being done in duplicate.</p>
